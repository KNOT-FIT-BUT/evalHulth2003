# Hulth2003
This dataset was originally obtained from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261860598_Hulth2003tar, but you 
don't find here the *.contr files because there aren't used in literature.

We add one new type of file *.uncontr_in that contains only keywords that are in the text.

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

This dataset may be used for research purposes provided that a

### THE DATA
There are three types of files:

.abstr: Contains the title and the abstract. When inspecting a file,
it should be clear how the title is separated from the abstract. Note,
however, that the title is sometimes longer than one line.

.contr: Contains the controlled manually assigned keywords, separated
with semicolon.

.uncontr: Contains the uncontrolled manually assigned keywords,
separated with semicolon. These are the keywords used in Hulth's
experiments.
